view their profiles as well as some information about their profiles like number of repos, number of followers and number 
as well as demographics and ways to connect with them via their blog, LinkedIn or portfolio website.

###  GitHub REST API

When you fetch a list of resources, the response includes a subset of the attributes for 
that resource. This is the "summary" representation of the resource. (Some attributes are 
computationally expensive for the API to provide. For performance reasons, the summary 
representation excludes those attributes. To obtain those attributes, fetch the "detailed" representation.)

:
### Basic Axios Request
```javascript
export function getAllPeople(page, name) {
    axios.get(`https://api.github.com/search/users?per_page=20&page=${page}&q=${name}`)
    .then(response => {
      return response.data;
    })
    .catch(error => {
      return error;
    });
}
